# Shooty Ghost
A twin stick shooter about a ghost in purgatory finding their way in the afterlife.

The mechanics build off of the usual twin stick shooter, but with some unique changes:
##Shooting
Rather than shooting an endless stream of bullets, your ammo in this game is tiny demons that you find. Emphasis is placed on well-planned shots, and catching the demon after it rebounds off the target.
##Haunting
Other creatures and some props can be haunted! Take control of them and see what surprising ways the twin stick inputs apply to them.
##Constellations
Collect stars around purgatory to build constellations! This is your main method of progression, as collecting these stars will open up new areas of the world.

This is a Unity project! To try it out, download Unity version 2019.1 or higher, and open the project.
