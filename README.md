# maze_shooter
a 2D modular maze shooter Unity Project

This is a Unity project! To try it out, download Unity version 2018.2.2 or higher.

The game is a series of fast paced, simple shooter stages with unique goals, such as:
  "Kill the boss!"
  "Find the exit!"
  "Feed the space-cows!"
  
The design goal is to stretch the envelope of what a twin-stick shooter is to the very absolute brink.
The goal of each stage must be simple enough to fit in a sentence at the intro of the stage. 
There is a 'Super Mario World' style world map.
