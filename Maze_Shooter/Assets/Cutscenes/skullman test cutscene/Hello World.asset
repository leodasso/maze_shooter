  - Hello World!
  - It's me, the dialog panel.
  - One day i saw a cat in the alley. Actually it was more of a cranny, but anyway
    it was a nice cranny. There were bricks, trash cans, and a chicken nugget. So
    the cat. The cat had whiskers, and a strange creaky meow. It was like my favorite
    cat.
